    <h2><ins>The Setting Of The Story</ins></h2>
    <p>The story happens in a world called Pyrrhia. This world is ruled by dragons, and there are 7 different tribes of dragons, each tribe has a queen, and dragons that have unique look and unique abilities. There is also a great war, where all tribes (except for the NightWings and the RainWings) are fighting for one of the three SandWing princesses - Burn, Blister, and Blaze, each of them has an alliance with different tribes. To stop the war, there is a prophecy about 5 dragonets, “The Dragonets Of Destiny”, that will stop the war and choose a queen for the SandWings . There are also humans in the story, but they don’t have any meaning, and they’re called “scavengers”. Fun fact: The names of the dragons are given to them according to their tribe. For example, there is a SeaWing called Squid.</p>

    <h2><ins>The Plot</ins></h2>
    <p>The series is about The Dragonets Of Destiny - Clay (a MudWing), Tsunami (a SeaWing), Sunny (a SandWing), and Starflight  (a NightWing). There supposed to be a SkyWing, but instead, there’s Glory, a RainWing. The Dark Secret’s plot starts right after the plot of the last book, The Hidden Kingdom - Glory is the queen of the RainWings, and she wants to invade the NightWings to rescue the RainWing prisoners that got kidnapped by the NightWings to study their venom. The NightWings abducted Starflight and brought him to the NightWing island. This book is from Starflight’s view, and in the story, he figures out some serious secrets, including the secret plan to invade the RainWings and take their rainforest. On his way to help his, he  meets some new characters, including Fatespeaker and his father, Mastermind. In the end, some crazy things happened; Queen Battlewinner dies and the volcano of the NightWings’ island explodes.</p><br>
